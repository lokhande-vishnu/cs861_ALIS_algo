# cs861_ALIS_algo
Codes for cs861 course project on active learning using importance sampling.

Please find the complete report in the pdf file in this directory

Here are some small notes for each script

ALIS-one-exp.py
Code for single experiment of Active Learning using Importance Sampling (ALIS) algorithm. It is also compared against a random sampling algorithm.

ALIS-multi-exp.py
Code for multiple experiments of ALIS algorithm. The average over multiple experiments is plotted over here.

ALIS-other_algs.py
ALIS is compared against other existing state of the art algorithms.

plot-sampling-choice.py
This is the code for the sampling choices made by the ALIS algorithm. Elaborate description is in the pdf report
